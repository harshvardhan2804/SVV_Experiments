## Introduction

The field of Software Verification and Validation (SVV) plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, correctness, and quality of software systems. This repository aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding various techniques and methodologies employed in SVV through practical experiments.

The experiments included in this repository cover a wide range of SVV topics, such as:

- Static code analysis
- Test case generation
- Model-based testing
- Fuzz testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Code coverage analysis
- Regression testing
- Continuous integration and deployment

Each experiment is designed to be self-contained and includes detailed documentation and code samples, making it easier for users to understand and replicate the experiments.

## Experiments

The following experiments are included in this repository:

1. Experiment 1: Static Code Analysis
   - Description: This experiment explores the use of static code analysis tools to detect common coding issues and potential bugs in a software project.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 1 - Static Code Analysis](experiments/experiment1/README.md)

2. Experiment 2: Test Case Generation
   - Description: In this experiment, different test case generation techniques and tools are employed to automatically generate test cases for a given software system.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 2 - Test Case Generation](experiments/experiment2/README.md)

3. Experiment 3: Model-Based Testing
   - Description: This experiment focuses on model-based testing techniques, where a model of the system under test is created and used to generate test cases.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 3 - Model-Based Testing](experiments/experiment3/README.md)

4. Experiment 4: Fuzz Testing
   - Description: Fuzz testing is a technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random inputs to a software system to discover vulnerabilities or crashes. This experiment explores the implementation of fuzz testing.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 4 - Fuzz Testing](experiments/experiment4/README.md)

5. Experiment 5: Performance Testing
   - Description: This experiment focuses on performance testing, where the performance and scalability of a software system are evaluated under different load and stress conditions.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 5 - Performance Testing](experiments/experiment5/README.md)

6. Experiment 6: Security Testing
   - Description: Security testing is an essential aspect of software development. This experiment demonstrates various security testing techniques to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 6 - Security Testing](experiments/experiment6/README.md)

7. Experiment 7: Code Coverage Analysis
   - Description: Code coverage analysis is a metric used to determine the percentage of code that is executed during testing. This experiment showcases different code coverage analysis techniques.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 7 - Code Coverage Analysis](experiments/experiment7/README.md)

8. Experiment 8: Regression Testing
   - Description: Regression testing ensures that changes or updates to a software system do not introduce new bugs or regressions. This experiment explores effective regression testing strategies.
   - Documentation: [Experiment 8 - Regression Testing](experiments/experiment8/README.md)

9. Experiment 9: Continuous Integration and Deployment
   - Description: Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) are practices that aim to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software systems. This experiment demonstrates the setup and configuration of CI/CD pipelines using popular tools and frameworks.
